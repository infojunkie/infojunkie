Hello! :wave:

My name is Karim Ratib. I consider myself a software "craftsman", i.e. programmer, architect, tinkerer, learner, speculator, etc.

I'm also a lifelong music fan, learner and player. This will often show up on this blog as well.

<div style="border: 1px sold grey;">

I'm currently available for hire as a software consultant. I do well with the following:
- Designing systems, from proof of concepts to scalable cloud deployments
- Leading and growing small, remote development teams using simple processes and tools
- Deep-diving into conceptual problems and learning to apply the state of the art to produce innovative solutions
- Using open source Web technologies on the backend and frontend

I am best motivated when applying these skills to domains that interest me:
- Music and multimedia
- Social development
- Education and learning

[Contact me via email](mailto:karim.ratib@gmail.com) if you are interested - looking forward to hear from you!

Until recently, I led a fantastic team of programmers at a [great, small organization called Meedan](https://meedan.com). We worked on collaborative annotation systems for social media, notably applied to fact-checking. [We open sourced all our code](https://github.com/meedan).

Before Meedan, I used to offer my [services as a Drupal programmer](http://thereisamoduleforthat.com). It was fun for many years.

I used to maintain a [blog called "Confessions of an information junkie"](http://infojunkie.karimratib.me). Be indulgent, I was young :joy:
