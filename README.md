Hello! :wave:

My name is Karim Ratib. I consider myself a software "craftsman", combining professional programmer, architect, tinkerer, learner, speculator, etc.

I'm also a lifelong music fan, learner and player. This will often show up in my repos.

Until recently, and for 9+ years, I led a fantastic team of programmers at a [great, small organization called Meedan](https://meedan.com). We worked on collaborative annotation systems for social media, notably applied to fact-checking. [We open sourced all our code](https://github.com/meedan).

Before Meedan, I used to offer my [services as a Drupal programmer](http://thereisamoduleforthat.com). It was fun for many years.

I used to maintain a [blog called "Confessions of an information junkie"](http://infojunkie.karimratib.me). Be indulgent, I was young :joy:
