Hello! :wave:

My name is Karim Ratib. I consider myself a software "craftsman", combining professional programmer, architect, tinkerer, learner, speculator, etc.

I'm also a lifelong music fan, learner and player. This will often show up in my repos.

I'm currently part of the incredible project that is the Internet Archive, mostly working on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). 

Until 2020, and for ~10 years, I led a fantastic team of programmers at a [great, small organization called Meedan](https://meedan.com). We worked on collaborative annotation systems for social media, notably applied to fact-checking. [We open sourced all our code](https://github.com/meedan).

Before Meedan, we get into archeology - thanks to Internet Archive for preserving my sites :raised_hands: 
- I offered my [services as a Drupal programmer](https://web.archive.org/web/20150511035727/http://thereisamoduleforthat.com/). It was fun for many years :partying_face:
- I maintained a [blog called "Confessions of an information junkie"](https://web.archive.org/web/20181029071954/http://infojunkie.karimratib.me/). Lots of half-baked ideas in this one :joy:
- I co-founded a software services company in Egypt called [OpenCraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20170422101115/http://www.open-craft.com/). We made lifelong friendships there :hugs:
- I obtained my [M.Sc. in Computer Science at Université de Montréal](https://web.archive.org/web/20021005070730/http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~ratib/). That was my first website! :baby:
